Some changes were made to the HTML file, including, but not limited to:

* Some classes were created to encapsule similar elements.
* Some class names were switched to IDs instead for better functionality.
* Previously disabled links are now functional
* Changed the position of some content elements for a better flow of information to the users.
* Reorganized the styles.css file and tagged the file accordingly with comments for a better understanding to the reader.
